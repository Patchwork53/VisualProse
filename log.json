We were discussing music and how creative many bands and groups are. At the end of our conversation, my friend told me, half-sarcastic-half-serious, how much more creative the people in the music industry are than him and that he just cannot find good ideas in his area of research even though he tried so hard for such a long time. I was a bit surprised because I thought of him as someone very creative. However, it is not uncommon to hear scientists lament about their lack of creativity compared to academic superstars. I think about creativity in academia is a bit distorted and a straight view can help to feel less bad about one\u2019s own creativity.\n\n\nThis blog post is part of a series of blog posts about scientific thinking in deep learning, natural language processing and science in general. I am currently on vacation in China, and I wanted to relax a bit by writing down some reflective blog posts which capture the thoughts that were lingering in my mind for weeks or months.\n\nAre Theoretical Physicists Creative?\nI think the paradox that very creative people think they are not creative is best demonstrated by looking at theoretical physicists and compare them to children. In psychological research, it is well known that children score much better on many tasks of divergent thinking than adults do: They do not think about the limitations of an object so that a brick which is used for building buildings is suddenly a tool for weight training, or a door stopper, or a paperweight, and so forth. If you ask people to build towers of spaghetti and marshmallows children do better than adults because they are not limited by what they think a structure of a tower should look like. But all of this is mere idea generation. Is this really creativity?\n\nThere is another famous case of similar creativity among physicists which might shine a light on what the boundary between idea generation and creativity in research is: The undergrad theory of everything. It is a common problem for academics in physics to be tortured by undergrads who just invented \u201ca new theory of physics which can unify gravity and quantum mechanics\u201d. The problem here is that the undergrads do not yet have the proper knowledge to understand the intricate relationships among equations to understand what is permissible and what is not. They see the brick as a door stopper, when in fact a brick is used for building buildings and paving walkways. An important part of creativity is to understand what are bad ideas \u2014 some physics undergrads think it is just about idea generation. Do not get me wrong, idea generation is important, but it is not the most important part of creativity in academia.\n\nThis can go to an extreme if you work in theoretical physics and other fields where ideas are severely constrained by proper thought. There are so many bad ideas and so few good ideas that nobody really is coming up with anything good anymore. However, it would be ludicrous to say that people like Edward Witten are not creative because he did not come up with any good ideas since string theory. Similarly, Albert Einstein labored for decades trying to unify gravity and quantum mechanics only to come up with nothing. Bertrand Russel would often take a sheet of paper in the morning and work on a logical problem and write down whenever he found a useful thought. Most often the paper was still blank in the evening. So if you see creativity as idea generation, Albeit Einstein and others should be seen as failures compared to the children that churn out ideas. This demonstrates that the view of creativity as idea generation is problematic.\n\nOne thing that has to be understood when thinking about creativity is that some fields of thought are highly constrained in terms of which ideas are valid. To come by a good idea is a very lengthy and labor-intensive process. Other fields, like music, are very free in their expression and you can take any two ideas which do not seem to be related at all, mash them together, and with a little bit of work you can make it sound nice. I am exaggerating, but you get the idea.\n\nSome fields, like machine translations, are now more and more constrained and good ideas need a team of people equipped with large computational resources that collaborate effectively for a long time come up with, and verify an idea which will yield a tiny improvement. One can expect the constrains on ideas increase exponentially with time in any given sub-field \u2014 just like it did in experimental physics. However, while finding valid ideas is becoming exponentially more difficult these fields also spawn new sub-fields as offspring. In these new fields, it will be very easy to come up with new ideas since \u2014 similarly to the music industry \u2014 anything is valid. As the field progresses the idea space becomes more and more constraint and finding valid ideas is much more important than generating just any idea. If you work in an area which is very constrained, you should have more compassion with yourself. Creativity is not just about generating some imaginative ideas \u2014 it is more about finding strange ideas which are still valid.\n\n\u201cNot Coming Up with Good Ideas\u201d is Essential for Creativity\nExpertise is important and a requirement for creativity. You need to be able to understand what are valid ideas and which are not. The next step is to loosen up the boundaries between ideas that may seem unconnected at first glance. Psychological research says, that once one has one of these strange ideas it is important to hammer on it over and over to exhaustion. The idea will reshape itself from one form to the next and eventually, you will probably fail to come up with something reasonable that works. Science says, that this is normal and the further insights are made unconsciously. After you give up an idea, your unconscious mind is still in the process of piecing together the puzzle and you might arrive at something useful over time.

Some researchers feel that if an idea did not work out and you abandon the idea you also failed and it is a sign of not having creativity. But this step can be a critical element of creativity. It is important to have phases in which you do not think about an idea so your unconscious mind can make the connections that your conscious mind cannot see.

These ideas do not need to be totally different from each other, just different enough to not bother your conscious mind while you work on another idea.\n\nI think to have a sane creative process, it is essential to acknowledge and even embrace this long-winded exhausting struggle with multiple rounds of failure as an essential part of creativity.\n\nConclusion\nResearchers are often very harsh critics of themselves in terms of creativity.

We were discussing music and how creative many bands and groups are. At the end of our conversation, my friend told me, half-sarcastic-half-serious, how much more creative the people in the music industry are than him and that he just cannot find good ideas in his area of research even though he tried so hard for such a long time. I was a bit surprised because I thought of him as someone very creative. However, it is not uncommon to hear scientists lament about their lack of creativity compared to academic superstars. I think about creativity in academia is a bit distorted and a straight view can help to feel less bad about one\u2019s own creativity.\n\n\nThis blog post is part of a series of blog posts about scientific thinking in deep learning, natural language processing and science in general. I am currently on vacation in China, and I wanted to relax a bit by writing down some reflective blog posts which capture the thoughts that were lingering in my mind for weeks or months.\n\nAre Theoretical Physicists Creative?\nI think the paradox that very creative people think they are not creative is best demonstrated by looking at theoretical physicists and compare them to children. In psychological research, it is well known that children score much better on many tasks of divergent thinking than adults do: They do not think about the limitations of an object so that a brick which is used for building buildings is suddenly a tool for weight training, or a door stopper, or a paperweight, and so forth. If you ask people to build towers of spaghetti and marshmallows children do better than adults because they are not limited by what they think a structure of a tower should look like. But all of this is mere idea generation. Is this really creativity?\n\nThere is another famous case of similar creativity among physicists which might shine a light on what the boundary between idea generation and creativity in research is: The undergrad theory of everything. It is a common problem for academics in physics to be tortured by undergrads who just invented \u201ca new theory of physics which can unify gravity and quantum mechanics\u201d. The problem here is that the undergrads do not yet have the proper knowledge to understand the intricate relationships among equations to understand what is permissible and what is not. They see the brick as a door stopper, when in fact a brick is used for building buildings and paving walkways. An important part of creativity is to understand what are bad ideas \u2014 some physics undergrads think it is just about idea generation. Do not get me wrong, idea generation is important, but it is not the most important part of creativity in academia.\n\nThis can go to an extreme if you work in theoretical physics and other fields where ideas are severely constrained by proper thought. There are so many bad ideas and so few good ideas that nobody really is coming up with anything good anymore. However, it would be ludicrous to say that people like Edward Witten are not creative because he did not come up with any good ideas since string theory. Similarly, Albert Einstein labored for decades trying to unify gravity and quantum mechanics only to come up with nothing. Bertrand Russel would often take a sheet of paper in the morning and work on a logical problem and write down whenever he found a useful thought. Most often the paper was still blank in the evening. So if you see creativity as idea generation, Albeit Einstein and others should be seen as failures compared to the children that churn out ideas. This demonstrates that the view of creativity as idea generation is problematic.\n\nOne thing that has to be understood when thinking about creativity is that some fields of thought are highly constrained in terms of which ideas are valid. To come by a good idea is a very lengthy and labor-intensive process. Other fields, like music, are very free in their expression and you can take any two ideas which do not seem to be related at all, mash them together, and with a little bit of work you can make it sound nice. I am exaggerating, but you get the idea.\n\nSome fields, like machine translations, are now more and more constrained and good ideas need a team of people equipped with large computational resources that collaborate effectively for a long time come up with, and verify an idea which will yield a tiny improvement. One can expect the constrains on ideas increase exponentially with time in any given sub-field \u2014 just like it did in experimental physics. However, while finding valid ideas is becoming exponentially more difficult these fields also spawn new sub-fields as offspring. In these new fields, it will be very easy to come up with new ideas since \u2014 similarly to the music industry \u2014 anything is valid. As the field progresses the idea space becomes more and more constraint and finding valid ideas is much more important than generating just any idea. If you work in an area which is very constrained, you should have more compassion with yourself. Creativity is not just about generating some imaginative ideas \u2014 it is more about finding strange ideas which are still valid.\n\n\u201cNot Coming Up with Good Ideas\u201d is Essential for Creativity\nExpertise is important and a requirement for creativity. You need to be able to understand what are valid ideas and which are not. The next step is to loosen up the boundaries between ideas that may seem unconnected at first glance. Psychological research says, that once one has one of these strange ideas it is important to hammer on it over and over to exhaustion. The idea will reshape itself from one form to the next and eventually, you will probably fail to come up with something reasonable that works. Science says, that this is normal and the further insights are made unconsciously. After you give up an idea, your unconscious mind is still in the process of piecing together the puzzle and you might arrive at something useful over time. With the next puzzle piece put into place by your unconscious mind, you might be able to make some progress on an idea which might lead to a working valid idea.\n\nMany researchers fail in the creative process because they do not understand it well.

It is most useful if you are a computer science student aiming to study machine learning and, in particular, natural language processing in the US, but most of the information here is equally valid for any field of research and any country.\n\nThe choice of grad school that is right for you can be tricky and confusing. We live in a time of hyper-competitiveness, where even undergrads need to optimize for metrics like paper count to make it to the next level \u2014 grad school. This heavily career-centered perspective was probably advantageous to get you into grad school, and it remains crucial to get you to the level after that: a great job in industry or academia. So choosing the school which is best for your career can feel like an obvious choice. However, a PhD is a very long journey, and choosing your grad school based on this perspective alone might make you more vulnerable to burn-out, disillusionment, and general dissatisfaction.\n\nIn this blog post, I will discuss this career-centered perspective in detail, but I also provide you with three other views that hopefully help you make a balanced choice that not only leads to academic success but long-term satisfaction and a full and rich life. Balancing your decision based on all four perspectives probably leads to a better choice than looking at one angle alone. Before I go into the details, let me briefly introduce these four perspectives: The Career Perspective, the Identity Perspective, the Stability Perspective, and the Variability Perspective.\n\n\nA quite intuitive perspective is the Career Perspective, which is about determining and weighing the factors that help you to be successful in your PhD and have a successful career.\n\nA different perspective is the Identity Perspective: not looking at your career but at who you want to be and how your choice enables and facilitates that identity. The social environment that you are in has a strong causal effect on your development: We are strongly influenced by the people and culture around us, and the friends of friends that you do not even know will make you honest/deceitful, selfish/selfless, caring/exploiting, and so forth. If you choose a school where the unwritten motto is \u201cThe worth of a person is measured in papers and citations\u201d you will slowly but surely grow to be a person that would live by such a motto. Would you like to be such a person? So by choosing a school you in some way also define and constrain the person that you can become.\n\nThe Stability Perspective says that choosing the \u201cright\u201d school is an illusion but that there are other choices that matter much more because they give you the stability that you need to succeed in the arduous PhD journey. It is well known that the effect of most moderately painful or enjoyable events that significantly affect your life will wear off within about two years and that you will return to your baseline happiness and stay there. However, some things are more stable. A great and friendly social environment where you always feel supported and not alone will provide you with the most human needs and will make a 5-year-or-so journey a breeze. On the other hand, a tiny research group with a distant advisor will make for an uncertain, lonely, and stressful 5 years.\n\nAnother valid way to select a school is by the variability of experience it will offer \u2014 the Variability Perspective. You probably sacrificed in some way to get into grad school. You neglected your passions outside work, neglected friends or your partner or your family, neglected self-development, neglected to work on your mental, physical or spiritual health, or you neglected other things that are important to you. By choosing the school that is best for your career, you might very well continue on this path of neglect. When does it stop?
